i am building an app that takes in user input of course materials and the ai application generates interactive flashcards and activities to study the material. generate template code html for the ui

can you write the css for it to look professional and put it in a separate file?

send the form data for file and text data to index.ts

can you make a separate javascript file with this function and connect it with the html. in the least amount of code possible

make a simple api endpoint for generate-flashcards

I am getting this error: Received text for flashcard generation: null

the response type of the request to the api is an "object". correctly parse the json inside the object

i am getting the error Received text for flashcard generation: geometry
[wrangler:error] SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'H', "Here are s"... is not valid JSON

sometimes the ai worker is returning 

the program never console.logged "!!!!!!" which means it never reached this statement. when i was clicking on the generate button, it should have uploaded a file which should take me to that function to log "!!!!!!". think about what the error might be. 

can you make a workflow that inserts into a vector database upon uploading of materials/text. make this a separate file
