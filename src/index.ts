/**
 * Welcome to Cloudflare Workers!
 *
 * This is a template for a Scheduled Worker: a Worker that can run on a
 * configurable interval:
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/triggers/cron-triggers/
 *
 * - Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to start a development server
 * - Run `curl "http://localhost:8787/__scheduled?cron=*+*+*+*+*"` to see your Worker in action
 * - Run `npm run deploy` to publish your Worker
 *
 * Bind resources to your Worker in `wrangler.jsonc`. After adding bindings, a type definition for the
 * `Env` object can be regenerated with `npm run cf-typegen`.
 *
